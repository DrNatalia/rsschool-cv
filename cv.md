3. I have been working as a doctor for more than 4 years, specializing in allergist-immunologist. In my free time I enjoy programming. Lately, I have found programming to be a great pleasure for me, so I decided to change my field of activity. I hope my persistence will help me achieve heights in this area.

5. *Example code:*
``` 
    
function countUser(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3){
    if(arg_3 === 1){
        let S = arg_1 * arg_2
        return S
    }
    else if(arg_3 === 2){
        let p = 2 * (arg_1 + arg_2)
        return p
    }
    else{
        return false
    }

}
console.log(countUser(width, length, choiceCount));

```

7. I am a graduate of the Izhevsk State Medical Academy, also of the Kazan Federal University, majoring in allergology and immunology.
8. My level of English is A1, which is why I often have to resort to Google translator, and I also plan to study with a tutor.
